# Lion Portefolio 
The "Lion" portfolio is a passive portfolio that allows for the management of long-term financial assets, with exceptional returns (annualized returns over 40 years of 44.63%) and very controlled maximum annual and monthly drawdowns (-10.9% and -21.9% respectively). The portfolio is on historical highs 41.9% of the months, which in itself gives an idea of its regularity. This result is obtained by combining five approaches to financial investments: 

Dual Momentum, an approach with a large literature (see Risk Premia Harvesting Through Dual Momentum, by Gary Antonacci), which consists of selecting the asset within an asset class that has performed best over x number of rolling months (usually 12 months)
Asset class diversification: 8 asset classes are used for the portfolio with performance stabilization mechanisms between them. 
Cryptos: the management of cryptos with a one-day momentum allows to obtain outstanding performances. The portfolio stabilization mechanisms avoid the bad volatility linked to this asset class. 
Decentralized finance: linked to blockchain, this finance allows the investment and securing of a part of the portfolio with a protection of the invested capital. 

The values and the method obtained are the result of a theoretical approach on the one hand (reading the literature, research on the economy, model of market functioning) and an empirical and historical approach, with multiple values tested (several thousand variants of the portfolio were tested to find the values presented here). Here are some possible variants of the portfolio. Depending on the investor's preferences (more or less volatility for more or less return), the coefficients of the different asset classes can be adjusted.
